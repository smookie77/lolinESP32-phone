# Why?
This is a project to test the abilities of the brain-dead students of a technological school. And also why not?
It could be used by people who are paranoid of being tracked from their sim card since this device doesn't have GPS only wait to be tracked is by knowing the cell tower's location. Or it could be used by other brain-deads to flex their coding, soldering skills.

# lolinESP32-phone
A mobile phone equiped with nokia 5510 lcd display, sim800 2g module for calls and data, 17 buttons to navigate UI and all of that in a cool PCB!

# PCB
There's still some work left on the PCB, because of wrong footprints in the EasyEDA and some things that could be made better.

# Code
You only have to flash the lolin lite esp32 board with a USB cable and ArduinoIDE.

# Visuals 
Probably in Q1/Q2 2025 there will be even a 3D-printable box for the thing... probably... ðŸ™‚
